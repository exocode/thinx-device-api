## Change log

### TODOs Now

* THX-50: Builder (finish prototype)
* THX-49: Notifier (finish prototype)
* THX-55: Test build->update provisioning
* THX-54: Aggregate statistic data from logs for graphs
* THX-62: Enable repository watcher for attached repos on start, add/remove on the at attach/detach

### Future Roadmap

*Security hardening*

* THX-56: `owner` is stored as hash (but should be salted)
* THX-53: Add VAULT to support storing usernames/passwords for git and direct links
* THX-51: Refactor to UDIDs instead of MACs and owner_id

*User features*

* THX-52: Allow linking direct sources (maybe just use #direct switch and allow to store username/password using vault)
