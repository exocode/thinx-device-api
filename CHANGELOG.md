## Change log

### Hopefully The Last Week

**ROADMAP**

* 1: Profile Editing
* 2: Device Editing
* 3: Use API Keys from Redis
* 4: Working Arduino C implementation (lib?)
* 5: Bare data support (LUA/uPy)
* 6: Statistics
* 7: Fix postfix
* 8: Builder, build tests

### Last week

11/5/2017 - 1.4.722: big laundry done; added HTTPS-proxy; build progress tracking, prototyping Redis API Key storage

10/5/2017 - fixing regressions and bugs

9/5/2017 - major refactoring

8/5/2017 - 1.4.603: Watching sources repositories attached to devices for changes, enabled build logger, updated build directory/repository structure, simplified registration request (should not require 'owner' parameter anymore); advanced update-notifier implementation; database compact job

### Fourth week

7/5/2017 - 1.3.585: Added API endpoints for fetching audit log, build log list and build log (incomplete), builder now saves build logs next to build/envelope file with same filename (build-id)

6/5/2017 - 1.3.581: Core client implementation templates for ESP8266/NodeMCU LUA and Micropython-based firmwares (registration and SPIFFS only, no OTA, not tested)

5/5/2017 - 1.3.576: improved tests, enabled editing device alias through API, working logrotate; working device registration step (with issues only on device side)

3/5/2017 - 1.3.559: API key now requires alias, audit logging

2/5/2017 - 1.3.550: changed build API to secure, updated tests; UI advancements (attach/detach/build)

### Third week

1/5/2017 - 1.2.533: re-tested and improved device registration, new UI

29/4/2017 - 1.2.516: working login, API and RSA key creation and revocation, session,

28/4/2017 - 1.2.489: stabilized nightly build, added device/attach and device/detach endpoints to add firmware repositories to devices, stub for static firmware serving

27/4/2017 - 1.2.413: REDIS Session Management, Startup Service, API for listing/adding RSA-keys; session-store is safe now; key revocation requires DELETE request and is based on key-hash now as the API Key is not shown more than once anymore.

26/4/2017 - 1.1.344 Fixing bugs and analyzing Session issue

25/4/2017 - 1.1.339 Working repository list

24/4/2017 - 1.1.317 Working account creation and password reset

### Second week

23/4/2017 - 1.1.249:: never store passwords. advancing in activation/password set/reset

19/4/2017 - 1.1.219: API Key revocation (from UI)

18/4/2017 - 1.1.203: Secure endpoints for listing and generating new API keys

### First week

16/4/2017 - 1.0.12: Created asynchronous polling git-watcher (Repository class), improved tests

15/4/2017 - 1.0.0: Semantic versioning, firmware update-on-checkin, Deployment, Envelopes, UDID,
Device registration with API key

14/4/2017 - 0.3.0: Express Router, Security (api_key, origin, fixes, device router)

13/4/2017 - 0.2.0: Thinx header, Circle CI, tests and ESLint

12/4/2017 - 0.0.6: Rewritten API router, working authentication

11/4/2017 - 0.0.5: MQTT/Slack Notifications, Sessions

10/4/2017 - 0.0.2: Builder and notifier

09/4/2017 - 0.0.1: Device registration
