## Change log

**ROADMAP**

It seems to be almost done. Let's have a week for fixing bugs and tweaking. There are still things that would not work after initial install (tech tail, e.g. mqtt configuration and other post-installs; bulk UI operations though update functions)

* 1: Async log should write to logfile instead of shellscript for tailing.
* 2: Builder Logging, build tests
* 3: Bare data support (LUA/uPy) for dumb firmwares (there is a lot of them)
* 4: Improve statistics (count last 24 hours or something)
* 5: Make devices respond/receive MQTT messages (LUA first)

### Fourth week

7/5/2017 - 1.3.585: Added API endpoints for fetching audit log, build log list and build log (incomplete), builder now saves build logs next to build/envelope file with same filename (build-id)
